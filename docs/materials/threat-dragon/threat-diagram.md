# Threat Diagram Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you create a threat diagram using the OWASP Threat Dragon tool. It also includes steps to implement a STRIDE-based threat model to identify potential security threats.

---

## Prerequisites
- Download and install the OWASP Threat Dragon application from [here](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon/releases/tag/v2.3.0).

## Steps to Create a Threat Diagram

### 1. Setting Up Threat Dragon
1. Install and open the Threat Dragon application.  
    ![Threat Dragon Start UI](/assets/images/threat-dragon-start-ui.png)
2. Click **Start Threat Dragon**.

3. Click **Create a new, empty threat model**.

4. Fill in the following fields:
    - Title
    - Owner
    - Reviewer
    - High-level system description
    - Contributors
    ![Threat Details](/assets/images/new-threat-model.png)
5. Click **Add a new diagram**.

6. Choose a diagram type that best represents your system. In this example, we will use the **STRIDE** diagram.

7. Save the threat model by clicking **Save**.

8. Click **Close**.
9. Open your newly created diagram.

### 2. Creating a STRIDE Diagram
9. Identify key system components:
    - Process
    - Store
    - Actor
    - Data flow
    ![System Components](/assets/images/system-comps.png)
10. Drag and drop these elements into the diagram.

11. Label each element based on its function in your system.

12. Click on an element, and the properties can be seen in the  to add details.

13. Click on a process or data flow and navigate to the **Threats** tab.

14. Apply the STRIDE threat model:
    - **S**poofing: Can an attacker impersonate a legitimate entity?
    - **T**ampering: Can data be altered without authorization?
    - **R**epudiation: Can actions be denied by an attacker?
    - **I**nformation Disclosure: Can sensitive information be leaked?
    - **D**enial of Service: Can the system be made unavailable?
    - **E**levation of Privilege: Can an attacker gain unauthorized access?
    ![Spoofing Example](/assets/images/spoofing-example.png)
15. For each identified threat, click **New Threat** and document:
    - Threat description
    - Attack scenario
    - Potential impact
    - Mitigation strategies
    ![Threat Desc](/assets/images/threat-desc.png)
16. Repeat the process for all system components and data flows.

### 3. Finalizing the Threat Model
17. Review the identified threats and mitigations.
18. Save your threat model within Threat Dragon.
19. Export the diagram in a preferred format (e.g., PNG, PDF, JSON).
20. Share the model with your security team for further analysis.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you can effectively create a STRIDE-based threat diagram using OWASP Threat Dragon. This helps in proactively identifying and mitigating security threats before they become exploitable vulnerabilities.

For further improvements, consider integrating the threat model into your Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

Happy threat modeling! ðŸš€
