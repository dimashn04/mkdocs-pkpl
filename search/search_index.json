Unlike previous models you've worked on before, threat modeling examines the system's security from the perspective of a potential attacker. Therefore, incorporating threat modeling as one of the main components of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) can help enhance the security of the product being developed.</p> <p>In general, threat modeling can be divided into four stages.</p>"},{"location":"materials/threat-dragon/intro/#defining-the-project-scope","title":"Defining the Project Scope","text":"<p>The first step in threat modeling is understanding what is being worked on. This involves several activities such as creating Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), identifying entry points that can be exploited by attackers, and defining assets and trust levels within the system. Reading or creating user stories can also be part of this step, which is sometimes extended to abuser stories or misuse cases to understand potential system abuse.</p> <p>Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are often used to visualize how data flows within the system, emphasizing system-enforced access restrictions and trust levels. This process is often referred to as \"analyzing application components\" and is commonly performed in threat modeling, with the end result usually being a Threat Model document. However, another more integrated approach is to apply threat modeling to each user story, as suggested by Tarandach. In this context, security analysis is performed directly on each feature or change in the application. This step also includes identifying the assets to be protected, although in some cases, these assets may be outside the scope of the project or difficult to identify until a real attack occurs.</p>"},{"location":"materials/threat-dragon/intro/#identifying-threats","title":"Identifying Threats","text":"<p>To ensure effective threat identification, a specific methodology such as threat categorization is needed. In threat modeling, the STRIDE methodology is often used.</p> <p>The purpose of this categorization is to help identify threats from the attacker\u2019s perspective. The DFDs created in the previous step can reveal potential attack targets, such as resources, processes, data flows, and user interactions. To further organize these threats, threat trees can also be used, where each tree represents a specific threat objective. Common threat lists along with examples can also assist in the identification process. Additionally, use and abuse/misuse cases can illustrate how existing protective measures may be bypassed or where there may be security gaps in project components.</p>"},{"location":"materials/threat-dragon/intro/#stride","title":"STRIDE","text":"<p>The STRIDE model is a useful mnemonic for identifying threats by encouraging us to think about attacker steps such as:     - Spoofing     - Tampering     - Repudiation     - Information Disclosure     - Denial of Service     - Elevation of Privilege  </p> <p>The following is a list of STRIDE threats along with their security controls:  </p> Type Description Security Control Spoofing Threat action aimed at illegally accessing and using other users' credentials, such as usernames and passwords Authentication Tampering Threat action aimed at modifying data, either changing data stored in databases or altering data during transit through the network Integrity Repudiation Threat action in the form of illegal activities in a system that lacks the ability to track actions that have been taken Non-Repudiation Information disclosure Threat action in the form of unauthorized reading of files or reading data during transit Confidentiality Denial of service Threat action aimed at denying access to valid users, such as by making a web server temporarily unavailable Availability Elevation of privilege Threat action that aims to obtain higher access rights to access information or infiltrate systems illegally Authorization"},{"location":"materials/threat-dragon/intro/#threat-ranking","title":"Threat Ranking","text":"<p>Threats can be ranked from a risk factor perspective. By determining the risk factors posed by various identified threats, we can prioritize threats to support risk mitigation strategies, such as prioritizing which threats to mitigate first. Different risk factors can be used to rank threats as High, Medium, or Low risk.

One way to identify countermeasures is by using threat-countermeasure mapping lists. When determining the priority of countermeasures, the approaches used often vary, but typically consider factors such as the likelihood of an attack occurring, the potential impact of an attack, as well as the complexity or cost of remediation.</p> <p>Risk mitigation strategies can also be evaluated based on their business impact. Once the potential impact is identified, there are several options for handling the risk:</p> <ul> <li>Accept: Decide that the impact/risk is acceptable (within tolerable limits) and document who is responsible for this decision.</li> <li>Eliminate: Remove the components that cause the vulnerability.</li> <li>Mitigate: Add protective mechanisms to reduce the impact or likelihood of the threat occurring.</li> <li>Transfer: Shift the risk to another party, such as an insurance company or customer.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"materials/threat-dragon/intro/#threat-mitigation-techniques-based-on-stride","title":"Threat Mitigation Techniques Based on STRIDE","text":"<p>Here are some mitigation techniques appropriate for each type of threat in the STRIDE model:</p> Type Mitigation Techniques Spoofing <ul><li>Appropriate authentication</li><li>Protection of sensitive data</li><li>Avoiding unnecessary storage of confidential information</li></ul> Tampering <ul><li>Implementation of proper authorization</li><li>Use of hashes, MAC, or digital signatures to ensure data integrity</li><li>Tamper-resistant protocols</li></ul> Repudiation <ul><li>Use of digital signatures</li><li>Timestamping</li><li>Creation of audit trails</li></ul> Information disclosure <ul><li>Implementation of authorization controls</li><li>Use of privacy-enhancing protocols</li><li>Data encryption</li><li>Protection of sensitive data</li><li>Avoiding unnecessary storage of confidential information</li></ul> Denial of service <ul><li>Implementation of appropriate authentication and authorization</li><li>Traffic filtering and limitation</li><li>Implementation of Quality of Service</li></ul> Elevation of privilege <ul><li>Running systems with minimal access rights (least privilege)</li></ul> <p>After threats and appropriate security measures are identified, we can determine the threat profile based on the following criteria: 1.
